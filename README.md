Analyzing American-Based Mobile Gas Consumption Using R
Introduction
In this project, we will be analyzing American-based mobile gas consumption data using the R programming language. We will explore the dataset, clean the data, perform some basic statistical analyses, and visualize the data using various R packages.

Data
The dataset we will be using is the "Mobile Gas Consumption" dataset, which contains information on gas consumption by different vehicles in the United States. The data is provided in a CSV format and can be downloaded from here.

The dataset includes the following variables:

Year: The year the data was collected
Make: The make of the vehicle
Model: The model of the vehicle
Vehicle Class: The class of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, sedan, etc.)
Engine Size: The size of the vehicle's engine
Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine
Transmission: The type of transmission in the vehicle (automatic or manual)
Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the vehicle
Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km): The fuel consumption in the city, measured in liters per 100 kilometers
Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km): The fuel consumption on the highway, measured in liters per 100 kilometers
Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km): The fuel consumption in combined driving, measured in liters per 100 kilometers
CO2 Emissions (g/km): The CO2 emissions from the vehicle, measured in grams per kilometer
Analysis
We will begin our analysis by importing the dataset into R and performing some basic exploratory data analysis. We will use the tidyverse package to clean and manipulate the data, and the ggplot2 package to visualize the data.

Next, we will perform some statistical analyses to gain insights into the data. We will use techniques such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis to explore relationships between variables and make predictions about future trends in gas consumption.

Finally, we will create visualizations to communicate our findings. We will use various types of charts and graphs to present the data in a clear and concise manner.

Conclusion
By the end of this project, we will have gained a better understanding of American-based mobile gas consumption and the factors that contribute to it. We will have used R to clean and analyze the data, and created visualizations to communicate our findings. This project will serve as a great introduction to using R for data analysis and visualization.
